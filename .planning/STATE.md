# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-10)

**Core value:** Surgical patch -- switch Provider only modifies credential and model fields, never rewrites other config content
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Storage and Data Model

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Storage and Data Model) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-10 -- Completed plan 01-02 (Local Settings and Tauri Commands)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 20%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 0.20 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Storage | 2/2 | 12min | 6min |

**Recent Trend:**

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5 phases derived from 23 requirements with standard granularity
- Roadmap: Phase 4 (iCloud Sync) depends on Phase 3 (UI must exist to refresh); Phase 5 (Onboarding) depends on Phase 3 only (independent of Phase 4)
- 01-01: Used internal _in/_to function variants for testable CRUD without mocking filesystem paths
- 01-01: iCloud fallback to ~/.cli-manager/providers/ when ~/Library/Mobile Documents/ absent
- 01-01: schema_version defaults to 1 via serde default for forward compatibility
- 01-02: Followed _from/_to internal variant pattern for local storage test isolation (consistency with 01-01)
- 01-02: Tauri commands are thin wrappers delegating to storage modules, no business logic in command layer

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Claude Code and Codex config schemas need verification against current versions (flagged by research)
- Phase 4: iCloud file eviction detection from Rust may need objc2 bindings or Swift bridge (flagged by research)
